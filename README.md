# Handwriting Recognition

This project implements a handwriting recognition system, which processes handwritten text and converts it into digital text using machine learning and image processing techniques.

## Features

- Handwritten text input
- Preprocessing of handwritten text images
- Use of a machine learning model to recognize and convert handwritten characters into text
- Display recognized text in real-time

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Handwriting-Recognition.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Handwriting_Recognization-master
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Upload a handwritten image using the interface (if a GUI is available).
2. The system will preprocess the image.
3. The machine learning model will recognize the characters from the image.
4. The recognized text will be displayed.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of handwritten characters for training the model. You can modify or replace the dataset in the `data/` directory to improve or adjust recognition accuracy.

## Model

The handwriting recognition model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model processes the preprocessed image and converts it into text.
